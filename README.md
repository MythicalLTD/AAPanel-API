# AAPanel-PHP
AAPanel-PHP is a library that allows you to interact with your AAPanel account using PHP. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API that you can use to manage your AAPanel account, such as creating and managing users, domains, and websites.

This README file will guide you through the steps on how to use the AAPanel-PHP library.

## Prerequisites
